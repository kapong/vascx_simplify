## Original Work

This is a simplified rewrite of [rtnls_vascx_models](https://github.com/Eyened/rtnls_vascx_models) by [Eyened](https://github.com/Eyened). All core algorithms, preprocessing logic, model architectures, and inference implementations are derived from the original work.

## AI-Assisted Development

This rewrite was developed with extensive assistance from AI tools (GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT, Claude) for:
- Package structure and build configuration
- Code reorganization and refactoring
- Documentation and comments
- Docker containerization
- Build scripts and CI/CD configuration

## Dependencies

This project builds upon excellent open-source libraries:
- **[PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/)**: Deep learning framework
- **[Kornia](https://kornia.github.io/)**: Differentiable computer vision library
- **[scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/)**: Machine learning tools
- **[SciPy](https://scipy.org/)**: Scientific computing
- **[NumPy](https://numpy.org/)**: Numerical computing
- **[HuggingFace Hub](https://huggingface.co/)**: Model hosting and distribution

## Inspiration

The sliding window inference implementation is inspired by [MONAI](https://monai.io/), a PyTorch-based framework for deep learning in healthcare imaging.
